#summary Rules for development, testing and production deployment

= Introduction =

Most scripts developed here end up in http://zetaprints.com/java as explained in this [http://www.zetaprints.com/help/list-of-web-to-print-scripts/ help post]. You need to follow certain rules of deployment to make it work.


= Development =


= Testing =


= Production =

Production scripts used in the core system are copied from their test location to /java/ by the sysadmin once they are approved. Usually it happens after some time of being used from the test location directly.

# the files are copied to /java/ "as-is", with all the subfolders and satellite files
# the original test location remains with all the files in there
# the links to the scripts are published in the [http://www.zetaprints.com/help/list-of-web-to-print-scripts/ list of available scripts]

Most sites will link to this new production location. Early adopters may keep the links to the test location, so we have to maintain both.
